## Does Bitcoin show cycles in its pricing data?

In this project, I conduct an analysis of whether Bitcoin exhibits cyclical patterns. Every four years, Bitcoin undergoes a halving, where the reward for mining is decreased by half, and the difficulty of mining doubles. This halving event is believed by many, including thought-leaders like Chamath Palihapitiya from the All-In Podcast, to trigger predictable pricing behaviors. However, I aimed to build upon previous research by providing more conclusive evidence.

In my analysis, I uncovered cycle patterns by normalizing the pricing data across different halving periods. Additionally, I demonstrated that these patterns are statistically significant using sinusoidal models, which are used to capture cyclic behaviors in time-series data. I also analyzed past monetary returns to predict the outcome of the current cycle, projecting a plausible range for Bitcoin's price by the end of the halving cycle in 2028. This includes a 96.57% growth in value, a $62000  value gain.
